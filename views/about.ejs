    <p>
        GameLog is a full-stack web application designed to fulfill the coursework requirements for the "Databases and the Web" module. It serves as a practical demonstration of building a modern, data-driven website from the ground up.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        The application is built on the <strong>Node.js</strong> runtime and uses the <strong>Express</strong> framework to handle routing and middleware[cite: 21, 22]. The front-end is rendered dynamically using <strong>EJS (Embedded JavaScript)</strong>, which allows server-side data to be injected directly into the HTML templates[cite: 23]. All user and game review data is stored and managed in a <strong>MySQL</strong> database[cite: 24, 38].
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <p>
        GameLog consumes data from the public <strong>RAWG Video Games Database API</strong> to allow users to search for games[cite: 37]. Users can create an account, log in securely, and maintain a personal library of games they have reviewed[cite: 31, 32]. The application also provides its own API endpoint to expose user library data, demonstrating a complete client-server and server-to-server data flow.
